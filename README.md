## Introduction:
```RemindR```is the back-end (server-side) application that reminds you when you have something to do. Users who want to use this app will be able to create an account/profile. Users will be able to send notification texts. Userees will be sent scheduled SMS messages which will let them know when an event is ready. Some examples include but are not limited to a pill that needs to be taken or you and a group of friends that need to make sure you follow through or just simply give your mom a remindR that you're hungry and need food. 

## Getting-Started:
- ```npm i``` the specific packages needed to work on this app.
- Set up an AWS account (they are free for the first year you sign up)
- Make a Twilio account and follow their docs on how to connect your phone number to receive SMS messages (you will be credited '$15' worth of SMS messages) ((messages sent are 3/4 of a penny, so you can run many tests before you run out))

## Running Locally:

 You will need a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio Number</a>

<!-- This is awesome that you explained what should be in the env -->
#### In Your.env File:

 - PORT: defaults to 3000, set to 5000 for testing purposes
 - NODE_ENV: set to development
 - MONGODB_URI: set to mongodb://localhost/testing
 - SECRET_KEY: set to your own personal randomized sequence of alphanumeric characters
 - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID: Twilio will give you this
 - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: check Twilio account.
 - TWILIO_NUMBER: check Twilio account for reference
 - MY_NUMBER: personal phone number for testing purposes
 - AWS_BUCKET= fill in your own name when making your bucket on aws account.
 <!-- Be mindful of your inconsistency between colons and equal signs, this causes huges problems if your users are copy/pasting these env variables in, all of this should be equal signs -->
 - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: set to your own personal randomized sequence of alphanumeric characters
 - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= provided by aws account
